## Introduction

Rock climbing routes found outdoors are often thought to be exclusive to mountainous regions with rocky soil, but is that really the case? Do you really need to travel to the Rocky Mountains or the Appalachians to climb quality routes? Quality climbing areas exist elsewhere and may not even be discovered yet. Being an avid climber, I am also curious if the types of climbing in regions throughout the United States differs. Is trad climbing more prevalent in the West while sport climbing is more popular in the Central United States? 
In this project, I used Mountain Project’s outdoor climbing route database to gather the locations of rock-climbing hubs across America. I compared that data to soil property data obtained through UC Davis’ soil properties map to discover which soil properties are common throughout U.S climbing destinations. Based on the common soil properties I  determined if there are any new potential rock climbing areas to be discovered in the U.S. Based on the ability to scrape Mountain Project, my analysis questions have changed slightly from my proposal. This is addressed further in the Analysis and Conclusion sections in the project report file.
